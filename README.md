</p>
<p>
Under the Agent Panel > Click Department > Click Add New Department > Fill Out the Appropriate Information

</p>
<p>

 
Under the Agent Panel > Click Team > Click Add New Team > Fill Out the Appropriate Information

Teams allow you to pull agents from different departments and organize them to handle a specific issue or user 

via a help topic or ticket filter. Having Agents from different Departments assigned to a Team will supersede 

the parameters of the Agentsâ€™ Department rules. For example, you can create a Help Topic associated with a 

particular product you produce, and assign it to a Team of specialist Agents from different Departments.
